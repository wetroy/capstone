PROJECT TITLE: CityScape Version 2
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: to use what I have learned since the first cityscape 
lab and incorperate it into one of our first labs to show the progress 
made.
VERSION or DATE: 4/24/15
DEPENDENCIES: The CityViewer class is dependent on the CityComponent 
class and the CityComponent class is dependent on the Sky, Grass,
Space, Building, UFO, House, and Road classes
HOW TO START THIS PROJECT: run the main method of the CityViewer class
AUTHORS: William Troy
USER INSTRUCTIONS: Run the CityViewer class and then the window should 
pop up with five buttons. The first decreases the order of the city. 
The second increases the order of the city. The third changes the sky
to either non-existant, day, or night. The fourth turns the space on 
and off. If the space is on but there is no sky nothing will appear. If 
space is on and the sky is set to day time a sun will appear and move 
as the order of the city changes. If the sky is set to night stars will be
placed randomly across the sky and a moon with craters will move across the 
sky as the order of the city changes. The fifth button turn the ufo on and
off. If the ufo is on a ufo will be placed at a random position in the 
window.
